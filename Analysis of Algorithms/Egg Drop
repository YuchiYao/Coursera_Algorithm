Suppose that you have an N-story building (with floors 1 through N) and plenty
of eggs. An egg breaks if it is dropped from floor T or higher and does not
break otherwise. Your goal is to devise a strategy to determine the value of T
given the following limitations on the number of eggs and tosses:

Version 0: 1 egg, ≤ T tosses.
Version 1: ~1lgN eggs and ~1lgN tosses.
Version 2: ~lgT eggs and ~2lgT tosses.
Version 3: 2 eggs and ~2sqrt(N) tosses.
Version 4: 2 eggs and ≤ c*sqrt(T) tosses for some fixed constant c.

version 0：Go from the bottom to the top 
Version 1: Like bst
Version 2: Start at 0 floor and then 2^t floor until eggs break. Then, the floor must between 2^t 2^t-1
Version 3: Find the size of interval sqrt(N), then from bottom to top sequential search. 
Version 4: Ask for hint(1+2+3+..=T)
